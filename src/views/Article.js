                        The Great Depression is a point in time when humanity suffered from the worst economic downturn in history. The
                        point that impacted the daily lives of people across the street, beyond the oceans. No one was excluded. Recently
                        there was another disaster to this scale. Covid-19 affects all aspects of our lives. With our own two eyes, we saw
                        the causalities and the conditions of the natural flow of society. Has history repeated itself yet again? With what
                        we've experienced with Covid-19, have we experienced another Great Depression?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The reduction of gross domestic product started the rippling effect in the workforce of both time periods. Work
                        would have reduced hours at best and layoffs at worst (<span>Unemployment during the Great Depression</span>). April of 2020 had
                        an official American unemployment rate of 14.7%, the highest since the above 25% of the Great Depression (<span>Iacurci</span>).
                        At a time of unemployment, both situations involved government support as a response to the (<span>Stock market crash of 1929</span>).
                        What transpired would be a period of isolation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The two events coincide with the immediate change in social conditions. Most individuals would most likely
                        experience more frugal spending (<span>Thompson School District R2-J</span>). They were both times that involved making do with
                        things you already have. The depression included budget celebrations and forms of entertainment that included
                        Potlucks and "thrift gardens" as well as board games (<span>Thompson School District R2-J</span>). Covid involved isolation in
                        homes, usually with roommates, family, or friends.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The bleakest periods of human history often led to anger, protests, and eventual violence. The great depression
                        brought the rise of the Unemployed Councils (<span>Foster</span>). These people brought upon the protests of the unfortunate
                        majority who were unemployed (<span>Foster</span>). The methods they used were modern, like today. Parades, petitions, and
                        marches were the standard (<span>Foster</span>). Police Brutality was normal (<span>Foster</span>) which is still an issue today. The Covid
                        Pandemic was no different in this regard. Protests were the result of disproval of groups of people against mandates
                        of masks and restrictions to reduce the spread by the government (<span>Key events in Canada’s trucker protests against
                        Covid curbs</span>). A notable protest was Canada with the "Freedom Convoy" that included Canadian truckers and their
                        dissatisfaction with the mandates affecting their work of transportation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Arguably, the most striking difference between these two periods of history is the methods we used to recover from
                        these disasters. After the Great Depression was World War Two (<span>History of Western Civilization II</span>). The war allowed
                        the unfortunate as they were listed in the military (<span>History of Western Civilization II</span>). By then, unemployment
                        insurance was implemented by the government <span>(History of Western Civilization II</span>). Covid didn't have a world war to
                        lean on. The solutions to the pandemic were isolation and public cooperation. The government implements standards
                        and bans to remove the opportunity of spread before a reliable vaccine Is produced (<span>Key events in Canada’s trucker
                        protests against Covid curbs</span>). That plan would be nothing without much of the public agreeing. The Great Depression
                        was solved by a government giving opportunities. The Pandemic, though still ongoing, was brought in the right
                        direction by a government giving opportunity, and the public agrees with it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Great Depression and the Covid Pandemic share prominent similarities. The cause of the world's problems of
                        unemployment, their social conditions, and the protests and movements are all examples of those similarities. Humans
                        often make the same mistake. History repeating is not uncommon.
